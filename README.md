### Hi there! 🙋‍♂️
I'm Marko Pekas, a front end developer 💻 and AI enthusiast 🤖. I love creating intuitive and visually stunning web experiences 🌟.

When I'm not coding, you can find me staying up-to-date on the latest developments in the world of AI, especially at **OpenAI** 🤯.

I'm always looking to improve my skills and grow as a developer 🚀, and I'm excited to be a part of the amazing GitHub community 💙.
